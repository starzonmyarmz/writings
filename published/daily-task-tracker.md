Daily Task Tracker
==================

[Mix Online](http://visitmix.com/) and [An Event Apart](http://aneventapart.com/) have teamed up to offer the [10K Apart Challenge](http://10k.aneventapart.com/1). This is a fun challenge where developers only have 10K to build a web app.

Just days before the competition was announced, I had started working on my own web app called the [Daily Task Tracker](http://dailytasktracker.com/). In short, it is a quick and easy-to-use chart to track daily tasks and the amount of time you spend on them. It is inspired by Dave Seah’s printable [Emergent Task Timer](http://davidseah.com/blog/the-printable-ceo-iii-emergent-task-timing/). After hearing the announcement of the 10K Apart Challenge, I knew that I had the perfect project for it. I rapidly sped up my development schedule and worked my tail off to get my entry ready in under a week.

The Daily Task Tracker uses HTML5, Many CSS3 attributes (such as gradients, transitions, border-radi, etc…), and the jQuery JavaScript library (hosted by Google, therefore not counting against my 10K). It also uses HTML5 Storage, also known as Local Storage. Mark Pilgrim has the perfect explination of what Local Storage is:

    Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you.

This means that tasks and the bubbles you check off are stored locally in your browser, so if you close or refresh the web page the data will be saved. Some day I might go into a more lengthy explination as to how some of the functionality of the Daily Task Tracker works.

The final version I submitted for the 10K Apart Challenge comes in at just under 10K (After minifying CSS and packing JavaScript), so I didn’t get to put in as many features as I would have liked. I’ve received a lot of positive feedback and some requests, so I will be continuing development which you can follow on [Github](http://github.com/starzonmyarmz/daily-task-tracker). If you have any features you’d like to see incorporated or any bugs/issues, please submit them on the [project’s issues](http://github.com/starzonmyarmz/daily-task-tracker/issues) section.

So it has come down to this moment where I ask you to go out and vote for the [Daily Task Tracker](http://10k.aneventapart.com/1/Entry/74)! Also, if you would like to use the Daily Task Tracker for yourself, you can find it at [http://dailytasktracker.com](http://dailytasktracker.com/).
